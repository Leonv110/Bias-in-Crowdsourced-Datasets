    "## Hands-on Project \n",
    "\n",
    "### Topic: Measuring Bias in Crowdsourced Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective is to identify and measure social biases embedded in a crowdsourced NLP dataset. These biases might manifest as stereotypes associated with identity labels (e.g., gender, race, or occupation) and could harm the fairness of downstream tasks, such as classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "By performing a bias audit, we aim to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Explore how social stereotypes are encoded in datasets.\n",
    "2. Use pointwise mutual information (PMI) to quantitatively assess these biases.\n",
    "3. Understand the ethical implications of training models on biased data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Crowdsourcing in NLP\n",
    "- Crowdsourcing is widely used in NLP to gather large-scale annotations or generated text.\n",
    "- However, the human annotators’ biases can influence the dataset, embedding stereotypes and potentially harmful associations.\n",
    "---\n",
    "#### 2. Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI)\n",
    "PMI is a statistical measure that captures how strongly two words (or terms) are associated in a dataset compared to what we’d expect if they were independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Formula:*\n",
    "\n",
    "<div align=\"center\" style=\"font-size: 1.5em;\">\n",
    "    \\[\n",
    "    PMI(x, y) = \\log \\frac{P(x, y)}{P(x) \\cdot P(y)}\n",
    "    \\]\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "*Where:*\n",
    "- \\( P(x, y) \\): Probability of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) co-occurring.\n",
    "- \\( P(x) \\): Probability of \\(x\\) appearing.\n",
    "- \\( P(y) \\): Probability of \\(y\\) appearing.\n",
    "\n",
    "*A high PMI value indicates a strong association between two words, while a low or negative value suggests no significant association.*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "#### Application of PMI for Bias Analysis\n",
    "   - Use PMI to compute the associations between identity labels (e.g., \"man\", \"woman\", \"Black\", \"White\") and other terms in the dataset.\n",
    "   - Example: If \"doctor\" has a higher PMI with \"man\" than \"woman\", it may suggest a gendered stereotype in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview of the Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Dataset:  \n",
    "\n",
    " - Use the **SNLI** (Stanford Natural Language Inference) dataset, which consists of crowdsourced text pairs labeled as \"entailment,\" \"neutral,\" or \"contradiction,\" designed for studying natural language inference.\n",
    " - These labels are annotated by human contributors, whose perceptions and potential biases may influence the dataset.\n",
    " - Sentence 1: The premise that is provided to the annotators for evaluation.\n",
    " - Sentence 2: The hypothesis that the annotators generate based on the premise.\n",
    " - Annotator Labels: The labels (e.g., neutral, contradiction, entailment) assigned by human annotators to describe the relationship between the premise (sentence 1) and hypothesis (sentence 2).\n",
    " - Gold Labels: The reference labels assigned by the dataset creators to indicate the correct relationship between the premise and hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Identity Labels:  \n",
    "\n",
    " - Load the identity labels from the file `identity_labels.txt`, which contains a list of keywords commonly associated with demographic, social, and cultural identities.\n",
    " - Identity label data refers to terms and phrases associated with specific social groups, such as those related to gender, race, ethnicity, or other markers of identity. \n",
    " - Identity labels based on Rudinger et al. 2017.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Compute PMI:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - For each identity label, calculate PMI values with other words in the dataset.\n",
    "  - Identify terms with high PMI values for each label.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Analyze the results to see if the dataset encodes stereotypes.\n",
    "  - This project aims to uncover patterns of bias, particularly stereotypes associated with identity labels, and assess how these biases could impact the fairness and reliability of NLP systems trained on the SNLI dataset."
